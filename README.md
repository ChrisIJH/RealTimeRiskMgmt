Real Time Risk Management
================
Introduction
------------
This is the project of Big Data Analytics Course at Columbia University.
This project consists of 2 different jobs to implement of risk management by finding **_Value-At-Risk(VaR)_** using 5-minute-tick-data with [Apache Spark][1]. One is data collecting job which is coded in _Java_. The other is compuation job for finding VaR coded in _Python_ with [**Spark Python API**][2]. This project will give an example of implementing VaR by utlizing not only [**Hadoop ditributed file system**][4] and spark cluster computing platform but also its computing algorithm with iPython's interactive analytic functionality. We used [*Google Cloud Service*][3].
